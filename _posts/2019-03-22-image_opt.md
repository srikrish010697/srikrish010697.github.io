title: Antlion optimization and Whale optimization Algorithm for multilevel thresholding segmentation
date: 2019-03-22 12:00:00-0400
description:  a practical comparison is made to deduce the best optimization technique amongst the whale optimization and antlion optimization algorithm, to solve the multilevel threshold problem, to find the optimal multilevel thresholds. Otsu's function is maximized to perform optimized thresholding-based image segmentation. The experimental results showed that the Antlion optimization algorithm gave better performance in solving the problem for higher level multi-thresholding.
