title: Structural health monitoring system for railway tracks
date: 2019-07-01 12:00:00-0400
description: We propose a multi-robot system for railway track fault detection, replacing manual human inspection. Our hardware prototype includes a master-slave robot mechanism that detects surface defects like cracks, squats, corrugations, and rust using ultrasonic sensors and image processing with OpenCV and deep learning algorithms. Our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model outperforms other algorithms in accuracy, R-squared value, F1 score, and Mean-Squared Error (MSE). The system is extended to a multi-robot framework to optimize energy usage, prolong robot lifespan, and improve network throughput. We simulate the LEACH protocol with 100 robot nodes to evaluate performance metrics.
