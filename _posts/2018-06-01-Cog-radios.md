title: Support Vector Machine based spectrum handoff scheme for seamless handover in Cognitive Radio Networks
date: 2018-06-01 12:00:00-0400
description:  We implement a spectrum handoff method using classical machine learning algorithms in cogntivie radio networks.  Spectrum scarcity is one of the major limitations causing hardships in the existing wireless networks. Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) emerge as a solution to tide over such humps. The ML algorithm will allow CRNs to predict the ideal channel for unlicensed users to switch back to when the licensed user claims back the unused spectrum.
