title: A Graph-Attention-based Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network
date: 2023-06-03 12:00:00-0400
description:  we propose a Graph-Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAT-GAN) that explicitly includes two graph-attention layers, one that learns temporal dependencies while the other captures spatial relationships. Unlike RNN-based GANs that struggle with modeling long sequences of data points, GAT-GAN generates long time-series data of high fidelity using an adversarially trained autoencoder architecture. Our empirical evaluations, using a variety of real-time-series datasets, show that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks based on Frechet Transformer distance, a prposed standardized metric and Predictive score, a downstream forecasting performance metric, that characterizes (Fidelity, Diversity) and predictive performance respectively.
