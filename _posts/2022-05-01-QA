title: Quality prediction using ensemble-tree regressor
date: 2022-05-01 12:00:00-0400
description: Proposed a tree-based ensemble learner to predict constructive and destructive quality measurement criteria for all units in wirebond production (A semiconductor packaging process) using multimodal sensor data (vision,ultrasonic,pressure,force etc.). Based on a hold-out test set, the proposed model minimized the normalized root mean square error by ~19% in comparison to the next best baseline performance. The model allowed our customers to predict quality measurement on 100% of units produced without destructive tests. During my time working on the project, the model was deployed as part of a smart manufacturing data analytics solution which allowed the company to earn a revenue of ~ 1million$.
