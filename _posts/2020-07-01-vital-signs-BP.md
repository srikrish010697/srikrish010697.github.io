title: Wireless blood pressure monitoring system using a dual milli-meter wave radar system and machine learning
date: 2020-07-01 12:00:00-0400
description:  Proposed and implemented an efficient mm-Wave FMCW radar-based non-invasive and non-contact vital signs (blood pressure) monitoring system using radar signal processing. A Gaussian SVM regressor was used to predict BP values using Pulse transit time (Time difference between consecutive R peaks) with an R squared value of 0.8 and 0.95 for systolic BP and diastolic BP respectively relative to the ground truth.
