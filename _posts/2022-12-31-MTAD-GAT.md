title: Multivariate spatio-temporal predictive maintenance using graph attention networks
date: 2022-12-31 11:53:00-0400
description: A self-supervised predictive maintenance pipeline proposed for diesel engines which consists of a user-behaviour forecasting model, a diagnostic classification model and a model-agnostic explanablility module to interpret forecasted faults. Here, the forecasting model uses GANs to generate future user-behaviour before the start of the mission based on several categorical and continuous-valued inputs from real-world and simulated data.
