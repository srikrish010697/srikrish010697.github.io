Hi there! my name is Srikrishna Iyer, and I am a senior researcher at ST Engineering, Singapore. I am passionate about exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and deep learning to build robust, unbiased, and interpretable artificially intelligent systems.

**Research**: Currently, I am working at the intersection of domain generalization, interpretability, causal inference and generative algorithms for a variety of domains including signal processing, spatio-temporal (time-series) and computer vision for various strategic business areas in ST Engineering including predictive maintenance, explainable AI and generative AI. For details about my background and research, please take a look at my CV and my projects page.

**Previously**: I have worked as a research analyst at ASM Pacific Technology, Singapore on representation learning and continual learning applied to anomaly detection and quality inspection for wire bond equipment. I graduated with a Masters degree in Computer control and automation from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore where I was advised by Dr. [M.F Karim](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00350) on wireless health monitoring and diagnosis systems using machine learning. I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and communications from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore where I researched on evolutionary algorithmic optimization and remote sensing technologies for structural health monitoring.
