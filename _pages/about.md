Hi there! my name is Srikrishna Iyer, and I am a researcher at ST Engineering, Singapore. I am passionate about exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and deep learning to build robust, unbiased, and trustworthy artificially intelligent systems.

**Research**: I am interested to apply machine learning to a variety of domains, including signal processing, computer vision, natural language processing, generative modelling, and explainable AI. Currently, I am working on generating interpretable counterfactual explanations for object detection models from joint multimodal (visual,language) representations. For details about my background and research, please take a look at my CV and my projects page.

**Previously**: I graduated with a Masters degree in Computer control and automation from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore where I was advised by Dr. [M.F Karim](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00350) on wireless health monitoring systems. I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and communications from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore where I worked on evolutionary algorithmic optimization and remote sensing technologies. I have worked as a R&D Data Analyst at ASM Pacific Technology, Singapore in the wirebond department on model generalization and representation learning applied to anomaly detection and quality inspection.
